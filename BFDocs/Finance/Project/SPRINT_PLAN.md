|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Team member leaves** | Medium | High | Cross-train team members, document thoroughly |
| **Scope creep** | High | Medium | Strict change control process, prioritize CRITICAL features |
| **Performance issues with large data** | Medium | High | Early performance testing in Sprint 10 |
| **Integration bugs** | High | Medium | Allocate full Sprint 10 for integration testing |
| **UAT delays** | Medium | Medium | Buffer time (2 weeks) after Sprint 12 |
| **Third-party service downtime (S3)** | Low | High | Implement retry logic, fallback to local storage |

### 10.3 Assumptions
