## üí° CRITICAL BUSINESS LOGIC

### Tax Calculation (Vietnam 2024)
```
Taxable Income = Gross - Insurance - Personal Deduction
Personal Deduction = 11,000,000 VND/month
Dependent Deduction = 4,400,000 VND/person
```

### Insurance Rates
```
BHXH: 8% (employee) + 17.5% (employer)
BHYT: 1.5% (employee) + 3% (employer)
BHTN: 1% (employee) + 1% (employer)
Cap: 20 √ó minimum wage
```

### Net Salary Formula
```
NET = Gross - BHXH - BHYT - BHTN - Tax - Deductions
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

2. **No DFD** - Modern teams don't use Data Flow Diagrams
3. **No Traceability Matrix** - Use Jira/Azure DevOps instead
4. **No Separate ERD** - Moved to Design phase where it belongs
5. **Combined Prototype/Mockup** - Into single Wireframes document
